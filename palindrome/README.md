## Alphabetically Optimized Palindrome with Partially Known Letters

This project provides a solution for generating the lowest possible alphabetical palindrome from a given string, which may include wildcard characters.

### Features

- Accepts a string of English letters (a-z) of arbitrary length.
- Supports wildcard characters (`?`) that can represent any letter.
- Attempts to rearrange the string (including wildcards) to form a palindrome.
- If a palindrome is possible, returns the alphabetically smallest one (e.g., `baba` becomes `abba`).
- If a palindrome cannot be formed, notifies the user.
