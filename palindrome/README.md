## alphabetically optimised palindrome with partially known letters 

* take a random string of English letters of arbitrary length 
* if possible, rearrange it to form a palindrome, if not, say so
* the palindrome should be the lowest possible alphabetically, id est baba should become abba and not baab
* now the fun part: let there be wildcards that can be any letter, so for example bab? and b??? should both become abba
 

ready, set, go :)
